    "Performance: Multiprocessing is suitable for CPU-bound tasks, as it can fully utilize multiple processor cores, resulting in improved performance. Multithreading is more suitable for I/O-bound tasks, as threads can overlap I/O operations while waiting for data, thus maximizing CPU utilization.\n",
